# gas-latlong-generator
Converts a place name into latitute and longitude values in Google Sheets using the Google Maps API in Google Apps Script, and appends these to the row in the spreadsheet.

# Usage
Select an active range in the spreadsheet (should be 1 column, each row being a cell containing the name of a place), go to the Code Editor window and click Run.

After the script runs, the latitute and longitude of the place will appear in the two columns following the name of the place.
